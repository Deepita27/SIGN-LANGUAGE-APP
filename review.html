          When my son told me he wanted to learn sign language to talk to a Deaf classmate, I was proud—but I didn’t know where to begin. We found SIGNTALES.com and it’s been a beautiful journey ever since. He practices every day, and the first time he signed “how are you?” to his friend, they both smiled so wide. I’ll never forget that moment.

          My daughter is on the shy side, but something about sign language really clicked with her. SIGNTALES.com gave her a quiet, powerful way to express herself. We watched her grow more confident with each lesson, and it’s brought tears to my eyes more than once. I never expected a website to impact her this deeply.

          I started learning sign language together after my father—my son’s grandfather—lost his hearing. SIGNTALES.com helped us bridge the gap. My son signs to his grandpa now, and the joy on both their faces is something I wish I could bottle. It’s more than a website—it gave our family a way to stay close.
